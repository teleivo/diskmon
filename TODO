# Behavior
* decide how to deal with errors on a check
* decide whether to notify on exceeding given limit or once the limit is
 reached
* try `fstat -f go.mod` (or on any other file), should I report the Free or
 Available? So `Bavail is the amount of blocks available to unprivileged users.
 Bfree is simply the total number of free blocks` Is the app running as root in
 the droplet?

# Technical
* setup propper logging

# Notification Message

* send notification to slack
* happy with the notification message?
* should we add the hostname? in case
 diskmon runs on multiple hosts and posts into the same workspace its not clear
 where the action needs to be taken
Use a https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#context
with an image element like so
 https://github.com/slack-go/slack/blob/93fe17cfad827ebb34316c683f29377c9be910e3/examples/blocks/blocks.go#L300-L308
to show the host
does the DO droplet set a useful $HOST or $HOSTNAME
